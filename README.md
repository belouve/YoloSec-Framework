# YoloSec-Framework
A framework for doing security by the seat of your pants.  Assuming you're wearing any.  Please God, don't tell me you're not wearing any pants...  Unless you're cute, then it's cool. YOLOsec reflects a security strategy driven by a “you only live once” mentality – one that emboldens people to ignore future concerns around security to achieve today’s gratification. 

- Break shit in production and blame the devs.
- Push code without source control
- Always upgrayedd on Friday at 16:45. Double Dose of dumpsterfire.
- /dev/null all alerts
- Comment your god damned code, Steve!
- rm -rf all the things.  
- Shitpost and troll.  Deploy a box of trollololol (Room for a story at another time)
- Click links with reckless abandon.  What's the worst that could happen?  It's not your personal machine anyways.
- Sudo?  Ain't nobody go time fo dat!  Run as root always.  Shit saves time  and makes disasters even more disasterrific 
- If you must comment your code, make sure it's functionally useless, contradictory, and hilarious.
- Don't be a jackwagon, [REDACTED]. (Or add links here to examples of being a jackwagon)
- Use your data like a drunk man uses a lamppost, for support rather than illumination. [More Data Isn't Always The Answer](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/ideas-work/more-data-isn-t-always-answer)
- Upgrayedd will eventually find you and you better have his money
- Set your S3 bucket full of customer data to public.  This will let us deploy our service faster, what could go wrong?
- Don't take yourself or others so seriously.  Remember this was a hobby before it became a career.
- Be a security team that is both like, “We need to stop nation states!” and also completely fail to patch your shit.
- Who has time for change control process and procedures? DEPLOY STRAIGHT TO PRODUCTION!
- Leave publicly exposed k8s management dashboard to make it stupid easy for anyone to take control of prod [Exposed Dashboards](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-business-executives-guide-to-kubernetes/#exposed-dashboards)
- Don't write pentest reports.  But if they make you, send a csv written in comic sans with vague descriptions of random vulnerabilities.  Set row height and column width to 1337, because you're 1337.
- DEEEEEPLOY JENKINS!!! (At least I got Check-In) [Sticker](https://twitter.com/mzbat/status/986649619097706498/photo/1)
- A flat network is always a good idea
- Rules of Engagements are for losers [YOLO Tweet](https://twitter.com/NPR/status/1032618799458144257)
- find /var/log* -mtime +1 -exec wipe -fr {} \; && wipe -fr /tmp* && wipe -fr ~/.bash_history  Don't wash your hands after you wipe.
- Your password must contain one upper, one lower, and one special. But how do you enter 'cocaine-cannabis-MDMA'?
- Linkedin is one of the weirdest dating sites.
- Safe spaces don't exist here in the real world.  Call people on their bullshit and expect to be called on yours.
- Store API keys in plaintext as an expression of your unending love for hackers
- Always never have a backup (Maybe also include storytime in a link)
- Commit code with broken tests.  Passing tests is for nerds.
- MAKE UPPERCASE GREAT AGAIN!
