# YoloSec-Framework
A framework for doing security by the seat of your pants.  Assuming you're wearing any.  Please God, don't tell me you're not wearing any pants...  Unless you're a cute infosec girl then it's cool. 

- Break shit in production and blame the devs.
- Push code without source control
- Always upgrayedd on Friday at 16:45. Double Dose of dumpsterfire.
- /dev/null all alerts
- Comment your god damned code, Steve!
- rm -rf all the things.  
- Shitpost and troll.  Deploy a box of trollololol
- Click links with reckless abandon.  What's the worst that could happen?  It's not your personal machine anyways.
- Sudo?  Ain't nobody go time fo dat!  Run as root always.  Shit saves time  and makes disasters even more disasterrific 
- Sometimes you have to go full retard to be understood by a conference room full of downsies.
- If you must comment your code, make sure it's functionally useless, contradictory, and hilarious.
- Don't be a jackwagon, Graph-X.
- Upgrayedd will eventually find you and you better have his money.
- Safe spaces don't exist here in the real world.  Call people on their bullshit and expect to be called on yours.
- Don't take yourself or others so seriously.  Remember this was a hobby before it became a career.
- Who has time for change control process and procedures? DEPLOY STRAIGHT TO PRODUCTION!  @TrumpDBA
- Don't write pentest reports.  But if they make you, send a csv written in comic sans with vague descriptions of random vulnerabilities.  Set row height and column width to 1337, because you're 1337.
- < obligatory fuck bitches, get money >
- A flat network is always a good idea
- find /var/log* -mtime +1 -exec wipe -fr {} \; && wipe -fr /tmp* && wipe -fr ~/.bash_history  Don't wash your hands after you wipe.
- Your password must contain one upper, one lower, and one special. But how do you enter 'cocaine-cannabis-MDMA'?
- Linkedin is one of the weirdest dating sites.
- Always never have a backup
- Commit code with broken tests.  Passing tests is for nerds.
- Pimpin ain't easy if you're the CEO of backpage.
- MAKE UPPERCASE GREAT AGAIN! @TrumpDBA
